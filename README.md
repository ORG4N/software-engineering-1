> As part of my Software Engineering 1 module I have been tasked to create a Dungeon Crawler console game using a given codebase. 

CMD DUNGEON is an exciting but compact game that has been designed for Command Line Interfaces. From slaying monsters to collecting gold, CMD DUNGEON takes the player on a high-risk adventure within the Command Line.

These are the most prominent features that define what type of game CMD DUNGEON truly is:
* PVE Combat
* Hardmode
* Monster and player scaling
* Interactable items (gold and health potions)
* A variety of different maps to explore
